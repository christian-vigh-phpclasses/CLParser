This directory contains several example scripts to be used in command-line mode. To run them, open a shell session then *cd* to an example directory, as for :

	$ cd 01.general

Then run the script either by invoking the PHP executable and supplying additional arguments after the script names :

	$ php example.php [additional arguments...]

or you can also set the execution permission for all example scripts :

	$ chmod +x examples/*/*.php

then run them by simply specifying their name :

	$ cd 01.general
	$ example.php 			# If you have "." in your PATH environment variable or...
	$ ./example.php 		# ... if you have not
